// JavaScript Document
// A function to work the transitions between selected and deselected cards.
// JK, I'll find some way to integrate JS into this page later on when I get more proficient.
// Everything I want to do is probably easier to layout in jQuery


// Maybe a canvas feature or animation behind the cards, depending on time of year

// Maybe a changing CSS stylesheet based on time of day.
// Oohh, maybe an animation that replicates the rise/fall of the sun/moon in Minecraft.
// But it's on a minute cycle, so you can see it quickly.
